# tinas-portfolio
## Description
This project was created with the intention of building a professional portfolio with links to direct users to personal projects and ways of contact. I built this project so all of my professional projects are linked in one place and are easily shareable to potential employers. This project creates a portfolio webpage, which can be viewed with any device, so that users can access all of my projects and contact me, if necessary. I learned how to build my own webpage from scratch. The newest skills I have gained during this project were to format the screen for each viewport, write dry code and adding effects only using HTML and CSS.
